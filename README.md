# Spotify Recommendations

A simple web app that allows users to select tracks, genres and artists as a seed for a playlist with suggestions. 

Basically a minimalistic interface for the [Spotify Suggestions API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#endpoint-get-recommendations).
